This is the Github repository for Team Tom 'n Suse's entry into the Gov Hack 2021 competition.

Our application is online at http://s1.flatpackapps.com/app.php?appId=27.

Most of the development of our application was done inside a low-code tool called Flatpack Apps (http://flatpackapps.com).  Tom McDonnell is the founder and developer of Flatpack Apps.

This github repository contains:
 * the data sets we have used, modified for the purpose of uploading to our app
 * miscellaneous notes used while developing
 * a scratch-pad file used for experimenting with SQL commands
 * screenshots from Flatpack Apps to show where the bulk of the development work was done.
